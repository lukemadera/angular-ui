# ui-forminput directive
Adds consistent layout (inluding input labels) and styling to an input element so groups of inputs all look the same. Also adds validation. Basically makes it faster and easier to build forms by making it just 1 line of directive code in your partial (rather than several) to create a full, nice looking input.
