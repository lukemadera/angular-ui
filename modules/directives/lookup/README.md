# ui-lookup directive

This directive allows searching/filtering content - it creates an input and wraps your own custom display of the content and then filters that content. The differences / advantages over the default $filter directive is that it can handle paging and loading more content (including hooks for searching/loading from the backend via a function you set to load more data (the (AJAX) call is handled in the controller by you so it's flexible)).
